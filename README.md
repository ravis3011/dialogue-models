Dialogue-models
=============================

This repository contains reconstructed codes for some dialogue models.
- [Seq2Seq](./Seq2Seq/README.md)
- [CCM](./CCM/README.md)
- [GLMP](./GLMP/README.md)
- [PostKS](./PostKS/README.md)

Note: All the codes are borrowed from the open source side where they released, which are reconstructed just for higher readability and easier running. The instructions of different models are located at ```README.md``` in corresponding subdirectories.
